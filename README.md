## Background
In this project, I built an interactive dashboard with tables demonstrating data about Belly Button Diversity. The data contained many people, which could be selected in the dashboard via a drop-down menu.

Using JavaScript and linking to HTML, I was able to create a dashboard that updates for each subject and can demonstrate the microbes that are involved in human navels. 

## Features 
* Using JavaScript to create a horizonal bar chart and a Bubble chart
* Have each of the graphs change based on the Subject ID selected in the drop down menu

* Connect the charts to the HTML and view in browser
